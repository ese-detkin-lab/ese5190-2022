To verify the operation of i2c, we used the code of lab1 to control the APDS9960 sensor. Then displayed i2c traffic on a k lab oscilloscope.  
From screeshots below, we can find that i2c has a clock signal to synchoronize the data stransfer. Also, it has a data line to send data from    
host to server in fixed format.
