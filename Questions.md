### Questions ###

Q1) Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand?

Ans) Thequestion description in lab 7 and lab 8 is not sufficient. Although, it creates a starting picture of the problem statement, it does not go into the details of the implementations and the objectives of the lab. 

Q2) Which lab topics have you found most confusing or difficult to understand?

Ans) The most tricky part for us was estabilishing the console implementation using python serial library. We regularly ran into synchronisation issues as well as the linking the code to c file.

Q3) Which parts of the lab have you found most difficult to implement? 

Ans) Certian aspects of the labs were more challenging than the rest. In lab 6, it was difficult to set the timing right , and divide the clock frequency just enough that we get a good i2c trace as well as not lose samples in the process. In lab08 and 09, it is difficult to set up the registers so that efficient communication between the sensor and board can be estabilished.

Q4) What steps have you taken to resolve these difficulties? Any other barriers you have faced to completing this assignment?

Ans) For lab 06, manual trial and erro was done with clock divider frequency and number of samples to be captured to get a good i2c trace. In the lab08, 1 sensor at a time was switched on and functionality measured, and only then the whole implmentationw as done.
