# REPL
## Create a REPL to read and write RP2040 registers from a console. 

- Select any 32-bit address to read/write (even if not a valid RP2040 address)
- Read/write any 32-bit value to this address
- read/write using any of the atomic bit-setting aliases and a 32-bit mask
- The RP2040 is connected to the computer via a USB serial port. You can use the USB serial port to send commands to the RP2040 and receive responses.
