## Writeup
Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? Be specific, and quote any parts of the lab description relevant to your answer (e.g., "modify the PIO/DMA logic analyzer example to record a timestamped trace of an RP2040-ADPS9960 exchange while the BOOT button is pressed.") I will make particular notice of anything that seems underspecified (e.g., words whose meaning is not clear from context, or conflicting interpretations of a deliverable).

The instruction is not hard to understand.

Which lab topics have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? E.g., "serial communication with Python," "aliased bitwise operations," "programming the PIO," etc. Be specific, and describe any lingering areas of confusion and/or anything that has helped you navigate them.

I/O operation is hard for me because there are no guides provided for me as references. The PWM slices and some stdio.h functions are hard to understand without explanation. Ed posts help me understand some problems, but it would be better if some explanation can be provided as documents beforehand.

Which parts of the lab have you found most difficult to implement? Again, be specific, citing any parts of the lab materials & your own code that are relevant to your answer.

Any parts that start with user input is a hard start for me. When I heard that a hybrid of python and c code will be used in one part. I felt really overwhelmed since I have no idea how to start. (Not to mention that I don't have the idea to use two languages at first thought.)

What steps have you taken to resolve these difficulties? Any other barriers you have faced to completing this assignment? Mention any students, repos, or other resources you have found helpful in completing the lab so far.

Helpful resources: Asking a lot of students. My lab parterner really helped me a lot in explaining and dissecting the labs.
