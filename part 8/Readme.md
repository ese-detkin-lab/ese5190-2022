# TODO: #
* Use the capabilities of your sequencer to implement the ADPS9960 protocol and control the sensor.

## ADPS Protocol: 

For this, we modified the example present in the pico-examples folder for the i2c bus scan in PIO. Based on how close to the sensor the obstacle is the proximity sensor gives just two values 230 or 231

Due to light conditions in the room, the color data was slightly affected. But, by covering the sensor completely, standard values of C were displayed.
