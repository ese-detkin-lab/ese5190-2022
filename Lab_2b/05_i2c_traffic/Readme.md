# I2C Traffic #

As we can see from the graphics, I2C is a serial, synchronous communication protocol, as the SCL or clock signal drives communication between the nodes.

The oscilloscope was set to digital mode (without noise) to get a better output signal.

We use conventional probes and logic analyzer probe cables to view the digital signal on the oscilloscope.

The I2C traffic between the Adafruit QTPy RP2040 and the APDS9960 sensor is depicted in the gif attached.
