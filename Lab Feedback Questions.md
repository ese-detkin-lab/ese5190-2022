Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? Be specific, and quote any parts of the lab description relevant to your 
answer (e.g., "modify the PIO/DMA logic analyzer example to record a timestamped trace of an RP2040-ADPS9960 exchange while the BOOT button is pressed.") I will make particular 
notice of anything that seems underspecified (e.g., words whose meaning is not clear from context, or conflicting interpretations of a deliverable).

Ans-More discription was required for the following:
1. "hand-edit" a list of register read/write commands on your laptop, and play them on the RP2040
2. Use the capabilities of your sequencer to implement the ADPS9960 protocol and control the sensor.
 
Which lab topics have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? E.g., "serial communication with Python," "aliased bitwise operations," 
"programming the PIO," etc. Be specific, and describe any lingering areas of confusion and/or anything that has helped you navigate them.

Ans-
1. programming the PIO: Not having much experiance with assembly language programming
2. Interaction between python and C program.

Which parts of the lab have you found most difficult to implement? Again, be specific, citing any parts of the lab materials & your own code that are relevant to your
answer.

Ans-
1. Part 3: More explaination was required regarding "hand-edit" a list of register.
2.  Part 6 & 7: Not having much experiance with assembly language programming
3. Part 8: More explaination was required

What steps have you taken to resolve these difficulties? Any other barriers you have faced to completing this assignment? Mention any students, repos, or other resources
you have found helpful in completing the lab so far.

Ans- 
1. Refered to other examples online as well as fellow classmates' work. 
2. Asked professor for explaination. 
3. Discussed with classmates.
