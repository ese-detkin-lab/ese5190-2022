# Lab Feedback Questions #

Q- Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? Be specific, and quote any parts of the lab description relevant to your answer (e.g., "modify the PIO/DMA logic analyzer example to record a timestamped trace of an RP2040-ADPS9960 exchange while the BOOT button is pressed.") I will make particular notice of anything that seems underspecified (e.g., words whose meaning is not clear from context, or conflicting interpretations of a deliverable).

Ans- More description was required for the followings:
"Hand-edit" a list of register read/write commands on your laptop, and interfacing them with the RP2040
Use the capabilities of your sequencer to implement the ADPS9960 protocol and control the sensor.

Q- Which lab topics have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? E.g., "serial communication with Python," "aliased bitwise operations," "programming the PIO," etc. Be specific, and describe any lingering areas of confusion and/or anything that has helped you navigate them.

Ans- programming the PIO: As I have not much experience with assembly language programming
Interaction between python and C program (It was new to me).

Q- Which parts of the lab have you found most difficult to implement? Again, be specific, citing any parts of the lab materials & your own code that are relevant to your answer.

Ans-
* Part 3: More explanation was required regarding "hand-edit" a list of registers.
* Part 6 & 7: Not having much experience with assembly language programming
* Part 8: More explanation was required

Q- What steps have you taken to resolve these difficulties? Any other barriers you have faced to completing this assignment? Mention any students, repos, or other resources you have found helpful in completing the lab so far.
Ans-
* Referred to other examples online as well as fellow classmates' work.
* Asked the professor for an explanation.
* Discussed with classmates.
