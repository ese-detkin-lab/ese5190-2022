# ESE 5190: Intro to Embedded Systems

# Lab-2B-Proposal

## 1.   Gif of my breadboard LED in action.

##	2.  An outline of what you plan to build, and why you think itâ€™s cool.

o	What are we going to do: We are planning to use LEDs arranged in specific patterns to indicate in which direction a car is going to take turn (left or right).

o	Why do we want to do this: This idea has practical application and would be fun implementing.

##	3.  Components requested from Detkin (after confirming availability):

o	2 Push Buttons

o	10 LEDs

o	10 330 ohms resistors for the LEDs

o	2 10 kilo-ohms resistors acting as pull up resistors for the push buttons

o	Protoboard

o	Breadboard and Jumper Wires

##	4. Proposal:

We have implemented the proposed circuit.

There are two buttons on the board: a slide switch and a push button. The push button enables the LEDs.

When the push button is pressed, depending upon the position of the slider switch, the LEDs in the shape of an arrow pointing in the direction selected turn on. When the button is released, no matter what the position of the slider switch is, no LED will turn on.
