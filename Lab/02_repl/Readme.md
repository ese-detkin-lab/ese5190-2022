Here, when the user gives input as "r" followed by the address of the register (for e.g. d00000004 for address 0xd00000004), the program fetches the value of that register.

When user gives input as "w" to select write to register operation. User will then have to input the address of the register (for e.g. d00000010 for address 0xd00000010) followed by the value to be written into the register.
