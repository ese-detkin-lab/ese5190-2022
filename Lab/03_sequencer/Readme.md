This program works when the c program present on the QT Py is integrated with a Python program that takes input from the user and writes data into a TXT file.

A C program contains 2 functions to read and replay the data sequence, which are called when it gets "r" and "p" as input, respectively.

A Python program reads serial input from the microcontroller (button press sequence) and saves it to a text file. Depending upon the input, the python program write "r" and "p" onto the com port to select read and replay the data sequence option.
