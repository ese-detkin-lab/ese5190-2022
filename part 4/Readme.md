This program works, When the c program present on the QT Py is integrated with a Python program that takes input from the user and writes data into a TXT file. The text file as below:

The C program contains four functions which are called by inputs "r", "n", "s" and "f". Input "r" is to read the data sequence, input "n" is to replay the data sequence with normal speed, input "s" is to replay the data sequence at half of the normal speed, and input "f" is to replay the data sequence at double the of the normal speed.

The Python program reads serial input from the microcontroller (button press sequence) and saves it to a text file. The python program writes "r", "n", "s" and "f" onto the com port to select the operations to perform depending upon the input. The output video:
